PSMetadataFetcher
========================

PHP and Javascript scripts useful to retrieve app metadata (size, version...) from Google Play Store


Usage
========================

Simply call this page:
<pre>
http://www.iosue.it/federico/apps/PSMetadataFetcher/check_updates.php?url=
</pre>


Using as url query parameter the url of app into Google Play Store, like:
<pre>
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.feio.android.omninotes
</pre>


A json will be returned in this form, the localization will depend on your locale:
<pre>
{
    "datePublished": "18 gennaio 2014", 
    "fileSize": "1,8M", 
    "numDownloads": "500-1.000", 
    "softwareVersion": "4.1.2", 
    "operatingSystems": "2.3 e superiori", 
    "contentRating": "Maturit√† bassa"
}
</pre>


Note
========================

To reduce data overload the following method is used:
1. Page_mirror.php script has the objective of retrieving a complete local replica of the url passed as parameter;
2. Once downloaded the data content will be stripped off of <img> and <src> tags as much as possible, but this procedure, due to limitation of used host, is accomplished with regex,not the best (of sure) way to do HTML parsing but it's quietly acceptable for our purpose;
3. Check_updates.php will perform an ajax call to get the minimum possible portion from page_mirror.php selecting tags with JQuery and will build a JSON object string to send back to client.
